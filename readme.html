  <body>The Darktrace app for Splunk Phantom allows users to enrich investigations and
    workflows with insights from the Darktrace Threat Visualizer. The integration enables
    users to ingest Darktrace model breaches and Cyber AI Analyst incidents as the basis for an
    investigation. Actions can be triggered manually or automatically via existing playbooks
    to acquire additional Darktrace information. These actions include gathering
    device summaries, connection details and comments existing within Darktrace. Additionally,
    acknowledgments and comments can be sent to Darktrace for optimized security workflows.</body>
