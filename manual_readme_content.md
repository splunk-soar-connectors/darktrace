The Darktrace app for Splunk Phantom allows users to enrich investigations and workflows with
insights from the Darktrace Threat Visualizer. The integration enables users to ingest Darktrace
model breaches and Cyber AI Analyst incidents as the basis for an investigation. Actions can be
triggered manually or automatically via existing playbooks to acquire additional Darktrace
information. These actions include gathering device summaries, connection details and comments
existing within Darktrace. Additionally, acknowledgments and comments can be sent to Darktrace for
optimized security workflows.
